* Starting -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#You must have an existing repository on GitHub
#You also need to have the repository cloned locally on your computer
#When a GitHub repository is created, it exists as a remote repository. Cloning it
makes it so that you can sync between the two locations. It also makes it easier
to add or remove files and push larger commits. You must have Git Bash installed.
#Git Bash is a command line that allows you to use Git features. Git is a version 
control system. You should have both Git and Git Bash installed. 
    - To see if Git is installed on your system you can type this command into the 
    command prompt:
        "git --version"
    The command prompt should display the installed version of Git.
    - To see if Git Bash is installed you can search "Git Bash" on your computer
    If Git is not installed, this is how to install it on Windows:
    1. Go to the official Git website and click the "Download [version] for Windows
    button
    2. After the executable file has been downloaded, click on it to run the 
    installer
    3. Select the destination location 
    4. Make sure the "Git Bash Here" checkbox is checked
    5. You can change the name or leave it as Git at this step
    6. Choose the default editor used by Git
    7. Select "Git from the command line and also from 3rd- part software"
    8. Select "Use the OpenSSL library" 
    9. Proceed with the option "Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line 
    endings"
    10. Proceed with "Use MinTTY (the default terminal of MSYS2)"
    11. Choose "Default (fast-forward or merge)"
    12. Choose "Git Credential Manager Core"
Now confirm that Git installed successfully by typing "git --version" into the
command line.   

#You can now clone your repository 
    Steps to clone your repository:
    1. On GitHub, go to the main page of the repository
    2. Click the green "< > Code" button 
    3. Copy the repository URL
        -You can clone 3 different ways:
        1. Using HTTPS
        2. Using an SSH key
        3. Using GitHub CLI 
    4. Open Git Bash 
    5. Change your working directory to the location where you want the cloned
    repository to be
    6. Type "git clone" into the command line, and paste the URL
        -it should look like this:
        $ git clone https://github.com/"USERNAME"/"REPOSITORY NAME"
    7. Press Enter to create the local clone of your repository 

* Uploading files -----------------------------------------------------------------
#Once you have both and existing repository and a clone, you can now upload a file
to the repository on GitHub using the command line.
    1. Move the file you want to upload to GitHub into the local directory that
    was created when you made the clone.
    2. Open Git Bash
    3. Change the working directory to your local repository 
    4. Add the file to your local repository and stage it for commit:
        "$ git add ."
    5. Commit the file 
        "$ git commit -m your_file_name"
    6. Push the changes in your local repository to GitHub

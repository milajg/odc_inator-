Welcome to our project! This project is a collection of R code to streamline 
collection, processing, and preparation of data for the social scientific analysis 
of computer mediated interaction, and to facilitate the investigation of the most 
common descriptive, exploratory and explanatory research methods that we employ. 
The goal is to organize code so that it is more accessible for students, advisees and
other research collaborators and to combine data collection, content analysis, 
sentiment analysis, and social network analysis in the creation of new datasets.

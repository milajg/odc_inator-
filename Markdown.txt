R markdown files are the source for reproducible documents 
An R markdown file can be transformed in two ways:
    1. knit: R Markdown will call a package that can be used to knit a file, called knitr.
    knitr will run the chunks of R code and will add the results of the code to the
    document next to the code chunk.

    2. convert: A file can also be converted to a new format. For example,
    a .Rmd file can be converted to a HTML, PDF, or word document. R Markdown
    will keep the text, code results, and formatting of the original file.

Usually, these two processes are done at the same time using render. 

The first step is to install the markdown package:

install.packages("rmarkdown")

A working LaTex distribution is also required, and if you don't have one, you can install the package tinytex:

install.packages("tinytex")
tinytex::install_tinytex()

After installing these packages, you should now be able to create an html document
